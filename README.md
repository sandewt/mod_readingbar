# Configuration / Features
- Download: https://github.com/sandewt/mod_readingbar/releases

- Install and activate (or update) the module in the topbar postion.

- Choose the desired Bootstrap color theme for the progress bar.

# Note

This module (partially) uses the Bootstrap progress bar features. Bootstrap is natively integrated into Joomla.

You can override these properties in the custom.css template file:

E.g. `height: 4px` becomes `height: 6px`.

```
.mod-readingbar .progress {
  height: 6px;
}

.mod-readingbar .progress-bar {
  height: 6px;
}
```
